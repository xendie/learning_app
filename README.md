- Authentication: registration, login and change password functionality

- Creating practice sets
- Deciding where the practice set is publically available or private only
- Measuring time - how long it took to answer each question and 
- Pagination
- Page dedicated to publically available sets
- Page dedicated to practice session history

The app isn't finished and fully functional yet.
More documentation to be written.
